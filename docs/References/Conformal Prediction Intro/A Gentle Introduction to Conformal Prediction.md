# A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction and Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification

## Introduction
The paper "A Gentle Introduction to Conformal Prediction and Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification" by Anastasios N. Angelopoulos and Stephen Bates presents a comprehensive introduction to conformal prediction (CP), a technique designed to provide statistically rigorous uncertainty sets or intervals. These sets have explicit, non-asymptotic guarantees without assuming any specific data distribution.

Conformal prediction allows for the conversion of any heuristic uncertainty measure into a statistically valid one, making it a versatile method that can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models. The paper also explores various extensions and practical implementations of CP, with a strong focus on maintaining distribution-free guarantees.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Conformal Prediction (CP)
- CP provides prediction sets that contain the ground truth with a pre-specified probability (e.g., 90%).
- The method is distribution-free and works with any pre-trained model, including neural networks.
- CP is easy to understand and implement, as it does not require the model itself to be modified.

### 2. Score Functions
- A critical aspect of CP is choosing an appropriate score function.
- The score function ranks inputs based on the model's error magnitude.
- A good score function ensures that the prediction sets are smaller for easier inputs and larger for harder ones.
- Examples of score functions include softmax probabilities for classification and residual errors for regression.

### 3. Types of Conformal Prediction
- **Split Conformal Prediction:** The most widely used variant, which divides data into training and calibration sets.
- **Adaptive Prediction Sets:** Used to balance coverage across different data subgroups.
- **Conformalized Quantile Regression:** Provides interval estimates rather than point predictions.
- **Conformalizing Bayesian Models:** Uses Bayesian posterior predictive density as a conformal score.

### 4. Evaluating Conformal Prediction
- CP guarantees that the prediction set contains the true value with at least the specified probability (1 - α).
- Evaluating CP involves checking the coverage guarantee and analyzing the size of prediction sets.
